In a *regression* problem, we aim to predict the output of a continuous value, like a price or a probability. Contrast this with a *classification* problem, where we aim to select a class from a list of classes (for example, where a picture contains an apple or an orange, recognizing which fruit is in the picture).

This notebook uses the classic [Auto MPG](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) Dataset and builds a model to predict the fuel efficiency of late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, we'll provide the model with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

This example uses the `tf.keras` API, see [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) for details.

Look again at the `train_stats` block above and note how different the ranges of each feature are.

It is good practice to normalize features that use different scales and ranges. Although the model *might* converge without feature normalization, it makes training more difficult, and it makes the resulting model dependent on the choice of units used in the input. 

Note: Although we intentionally generate these statistics from only the training dataset, these statistics will also be used to normalize the test dataset. We need to do that to project the test dataset into the same distribution that the model has been trained on.

Caution: The statistics used to normalize the inputs here (mean and standard deviation) need to be applied to any other data that is fed to the model, along with the one-hot encoding that we did earlier.  That includes the test set as well as live data when the model is used in production.

## Conclusion

This notebook introduced a few techniques to handle a regression problem.

* Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function used for regression problems (different loss functions are used for classification problems).
* Similarly, evaluation metrics used for regression differ from classification. A common regression metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
* When numeric input data features have values with different ranges, each feature should be scaled independently to the same range.
* If there is not much training data, one technique is to prefer a small network with few hidden layers to avoid overfitting.
* Early stopping is a useful technique to prevent overfitting.
